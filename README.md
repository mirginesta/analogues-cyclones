# analogues-cyclones

This Python package computes analogues of cyclones using a method based on pattern recurrences in mean sea-level pressure [Yiou 2014]. 

## Set up

This package is meant for the use of 6-hourly data.

To find the analogues, first we need to specify:

- N: number of analogues
- time of the cyclone: time when the cyclone reached its minimum sea level pressure (or specific time we want to compute the analogues on)
- spatial domain: spatial domain of the cyclone from which its analogues will be found

Then, we need to compute the Euclidean distances (Y) that will be a parameter of this Python package:

1) We first calculate the Euclidean distance between the sea-level pressure maps of the "time of the cyclone" and all other time steps at each grid point of the spatial domain.
2) Then, we average the Euclidean distances for all grid boxes across the domain for each time step, resulting in a time series of domain-averaged Euclidean distances. This is Y (array_like).

## Methodology

This Python package consists of a fuction where:

- There are two parameters: Y, which are the Euclidean distances, and N, the number of analogues we want to compute.

- The N analogues are selected as the time steps that displayed the N smallest Euclidean distances. We imposed a minimum 7-day separation between analogues to avoid counting the same cyclone several times. This is justified by the fact that 3 days is a typical timescale for the formation and decay of an extratropical cyclone, but specific cyclones can last longer than this (e.g., Alex, a storm in October 2020, lasted 7 days). 

The function is implemented in the "analogues" function. More information on the methodology can be find in Ginesta et al. 2022.

## Usage

To use the package, you can install it via pip:

pip install analogues-cyclones

Then, you can import the analogues function:

from analogues_cyclones import analogues

You can use the analogues function by passing it a time series (Y) of the Euclidean distances and the number of closest events to find (N):

dist_N_analogues, index_N_analogues = analogues(Y, N)
